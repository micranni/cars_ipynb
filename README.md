# Used Car Price Prediction Model Using Random Forest Regression

## Introduction

    This project explores the development of various regression models to predict the price of used cars based on parameters such as manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, odometer, size, type, paint color, fuel type, transmission type, title status, and drive type. The final model utilizes a Random Forest Regression algorithm. 

### What is Random Forest Regression?

    Random Forest Regression is a machine learning technique that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. It works by building many trees on random subsets of the data and averaging their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. This method helps capture complex patterns in data, making it useful for tasks like predicting continuous values such as prices.
